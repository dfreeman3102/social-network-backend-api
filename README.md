# social-network-backend-api
Thirteenth bootcamp challenge using what we have learned in class, with help from instructors, classmates, 
and outside research (YouTube tutorials, stack overflow, etc.) to make a backend for a social network.
When you enter npm run seed, then npm start the application server starts with the MongoDB seeded data.
When you open API GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes you are able to successfully create, read, update, and delete users, friends, thoughts,
and reactions within the database.
